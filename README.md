_blockchain is a simple implementation of blockchain technolgy it has some of its basic componant like proof_of_work and hashing function. Unfortunetly I did not implement the decentralisation this would be for another project.

- If you whant to know more here is an article I made on the concept behind blockchain [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-101-5e19b7249db8).
- And if you whant to know some of the concept behind the implementation of a blockchain project you can see another article I made [here](https://penyel-djegnene.medium.com/learn-blockchain-by-creating-one-3a38cc7b263b)

# Motivation
Blockchain has already begun to disrupt the world and change the way we think about the world. _blockchain was created to allow me to better understand how this technology work.

I build some of the components that make blockchain what it is. Some other components are not present but will be built in another project of mine.

# How to use?
All the code was transform into an executable that is named __main.exe__. You can stare the programm by cliking on the executable file wich is in the hello_blockchain folder.

- If you whant to change some of the code you can see the core implementation of the blockchain in the blockchain.py file and the main.py is the interface.

After running the executable you can either make some transactions, mine a block or see all the block in the blockchain.

# Tech/Framework used
- This project was made with visual visual studio.
