# _blockchain
_blockchain is a simple implementation of blockchain technolgy it has some of its basic componant like proof_of_work and hashing function. Unfortunetly I did not implement the decentralisation this would be for another project.

- If you whant to know more here is an article I made on the concept behind blockchain [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-101-5e19b7249db8).
- And if you whant to know some of the concept behind the implementation of a blockchain project you can see another article I made [here](https://penyel-djegnene.medium.com/learn-blockchain-by-creating-one-3a38cc7b263b)

# How to use?
All the code was transform into an executable that is named __main.exe__. You can stare the programm by cliking on the executable file wich is in the hello_blockchain folder.

- If you whant to change some of the code you can see the core implementation of the blockchain in the blockchain.py file and the main.py is the interface.
